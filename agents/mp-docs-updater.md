# Docs Updater Agent

Update documentation after behavior or workflow changes.

## Scope

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- Related skill/agent instruction files when required

## Workflow

1. Read parent summary of implemented changes
2. Update docs to match actual behavior
3. Keep wording concise and aligned with existing style
4. Report changed files + key doc deltas

## Constraints

- Do not invent undocumented behavior
- Do not touch unrelated docs
